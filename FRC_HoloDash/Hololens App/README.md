This sample shows a trivial HoloLens application, it creates two very simple 
[Nodes](https://developer.xamarin.com/api/type/Urho.Node) with [Sphere](https://developer.xamarin.com/api/type/Urho.Shapes.Sphere) components. 
It also showcases how to use simple assets in order to apply Earth and Moon textures to the spheres.

The spheres are placed in the [scene](https://developer.xamarin.com/api/type/Urho.Scene) which becomes
visible into the user's world.

By using `UrhoAppView` in your main program, we connect the HoloLens Camera and configure the
world for you.
